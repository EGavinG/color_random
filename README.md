# Abstract:  
[Colorandom Project](https://github.com/EGavinG/color_random)  is a user-friendly app that utilizes javascript, CSS with Flexbox, and HTML to display randomly generated color palettes of 5 colors. Users encounter a default palette and with the click on the “New Palette” button can generate a truly random group of 5 colors with hex codes to reference. Adding to the interactivity, clicking the lock icon toggles to the locked position allows the user to save a palette in the saved palettes section with the option to delete each palette as well. The features included are:  

- The ability to generate a random palette
- The ability to lock in a color on the palette
- The ability to save a palette
- The ability to delete a palette
